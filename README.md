# Data-Analysis-Using-Power-BI
# Introduction
The relevance of Business Intelligence tools in data analysis cannnot be over emphasized. Its use ranges from data integration, transformation, modelling, creating interactive reports and visualization, etc. This repository hosts tasks that followed my first Power BI lessons.
# Context
Understanding the basics of Power BI made the foundation of my learning journey. This included importing datasets from other sources and connecting Power BI to databases and other cloud data sources for the purpose of importing and analysing data. Proceeding from this, introduced me to data cleaning and transformation using Power BI. As in other tools, the key steps in cleaning data in this tool is not any different. However, data transformation takes place in a Power BI feature called Power Query Editor which cleans and refine data into usable forms before loading them into their models.
